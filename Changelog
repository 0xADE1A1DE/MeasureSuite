version 2.1.0 (2023-06-29)
	- lib: Bug worked around, which caused stack smashing. I don't know why this is
	  happening, but it turns out that if `get_fdperf` is inlined, the syscall
	  overwrites the canary. If we prevent inlining, this issue does not
	  appear. Also added some more attributes like size to the attr.
	- ms: Checking if there is a symbol, when specifying `.so`s
	- msc: Feature: new wrapper script around `./ms`. Give this script a
		couple filenames and it will report how fast all others are compared
		to a baseline.
	- Fixed a invalid extension check:
        Instead of checking, whether the filename ends with .o,
        the code was only checking if .o is in the filename.
	- Minor: clarified help text in ms-binary
	- Updated Typescript Dependencies
	- Fixed issue when `pkg-config` is not installed
	- Makefile, added missing `-ldl` to the link step for `ms`. This caused
	  issues on older systems (How did that work without?)
	- Makefile removed duplicated 'check' target
	- Makefile added 'DEBUG' variable. To use debug mode, use
	    `make DEBUG=1 -B`, which will define `ENABLE_DEBUG` and `-g` for debug
		symbols.
 	- Reworked printing if the check fails.
		Will now always print the hex, and binary if compiled with debug

version 2.0.1 (2023-01-19)
	- Fixed a bug causing out-of-memory after repeated calls to 'measure'
	  from the typescript wrapper
	- API: added the unload_{all,last} function to the native module

version 2.0.0 (2023-01-11)
	- BREAKING CHANGES  (API changed)
	- MS can now load elf (*.o) files (specific symbol or 'just the first one')
	- MS can now load bin files (raw machine code)

	- MS can now measure an arbitrary number of functions of arbitrary type
	  the default was: "one Shared Object and two ASMs"
	  now one can load a colorful mix of ELFs / BINs / ASMs shared_objects

	- MS no longer measures 'ac-bc-ac-ac-bc'. Instead, all loaded functions are
	  executed exactly once, but in a random permutation (abc-bca-abc-cba-cab).

	- MS no longer needs to have three functions calculating the same.
	  In fact, equality check is optional.

	- Directory separation of libmeasuresuite and ts-binding to make forking
	and reuse easier
	
	- Auto-detect AssemblyLine. Compile without it, if not available.
	  (disable with make AL=0 -C lib)

	- removed uiCA wrapper, as now considered out of scope

	- introducing cli-tool ms

	- npm package release

version 1.3.0 (2022-09-11)
	- now supports up to 6 arguments. i.e. 2 out's and 4 in's. Before, it was
	limited to 3 each 

version 1.2.3 (2022-08-17)
	- Bug fixed, which caused assemblyline.h to still be necessary although
	  `-DNO_AL` was passed

version 1.2.2 (2022-08-16)
	- Chore, tests address sanitized

version 1.2.1 (2022-08-16)
	- remove const specifier when getting the cycles

version 1.2.0 (2022-08-16)
	- new feature to compile measuresuite with the NO_AL flag, to not use
	assemblyline. Build with `make NO_AL=1` and use `ms_measure_lib_only` over
	`ms_measure`
	- fix a bug in ms_measure_lib_only, where the recursive call would measure
	asm-code, too

version 1.1.0 (2022-08-02)
	- new feature to ms_measure_lib_only and return an array of cycle measurements.

version 1.0.1 (2022-08-02)
	- Replace Jest with vite
	- bundle as ESM

version 1.0.0 (2022-07-21)
	- initial release
