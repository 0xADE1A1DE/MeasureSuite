# Examples

## TS exmaples
Generally, if you just want to use it via typescript, `npm install measuresuite` the package and use as described in  `./{asm,elf}/add_two_numbers.ts` or in the test folder `../ts/test`.

If you want to use assembly, install AssemblyLine before `npm install measuresuite`

In the examples here, we point to a locally built version, for which you'd need the entire repo cloned.

## C examples

To use the C examples, clone this repo as is, `make` in the root directory and use `libmeasuresuite.{o,so}`
